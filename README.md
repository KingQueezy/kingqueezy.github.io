(Header1: ABOUT JAIQUEZ)

(par1) After dropping out of college, and deciding to pursue an everlasting career at a Corporation. While also pursuing business endeavors. I got bored with doing monotonous tasks, and decided to expand towards something that felt a bit more ,rewarding. For the safe of my humanity. ðŸ˜€

(par2) As a Thinkful student, I've parted my ways and moved on, to brighter horizons. From this moment on. I am a Software Developer, and quite honestly, I couldn't be happier. 

(par3) If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are wanting a music friend) please hit my line! I'm stoked to work with other developers and innovative thinkers.
