		<h1>ABOUT JAIQUEZ</h1> 

		<p>After dropping out of college, and deciding to pursue an everlasting career at a Corporation. While also pursuing endeavors. I got bored with doing monotonous tasks, and decided to expand towards something that felt a little bit more ,rewarding. For the safe of my humanity. ðŸ˜€</p> 
		<p>As a student at Thinkful, I've parted my ways and moved on to, brighter horizons. From this moment on, I've become a Software Developer, and quite honestly, I couldn't be happier. </p>
